# ati_bench
blitz@smth initialized a discussion on the benchmark of an adaptive trapezoidal integral algorithm implemented in different programming languages. This project collects those implementation and try to accept improvement per language from contributors so as we can hit the best benchmark of each language. By this project, we can get a view of what is the limit of those probramming languages.
